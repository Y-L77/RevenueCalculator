hello, devlogs starting october 26 22:38, some of the code has already been written up to 5 functions in Main.Java
This is a solo project by YL77 or Yipeng Lu, copyright licensing terms: CC BY - open to commerical use and modification but please credit.

October 26th,
I want to add data storage with good principles in a different class so I can have easy and modular method to change the value of the data through functions in the stored data file.
Right now I definentely want to add graphics to this java project by maybe using a java graphics library or using this as a backend script and then turn this into a fullstack project by atting a frontend.
Also I modified the switch block because of my older java version.
Right now, im using variables to make gates and things to control the flow of the logic of my code but I think I'm going to resort to boolean values and infinite loops with exit options so I can intergrate it into graphics with an exit or backspace icon later.
NOTE TO FUTURE, PROBABLY TOMORROW: Hello, it's 23:25 right now and looking at the messy code makes me dizzy. I ain't doing allat, fix the loops and logic with infinite while boolean loops later.

October 27th
Hello, it's still 11:30 on the 26th but you best get to work tomorrow or else ill be poor and unsucessful.
